**Description:**\
This project enables users to remotely power on and unlock a PC using an Android application, offering convenient control without needing physical access. Our goal was to create a solution that maintains connectivity with a remote PC even if it unexpectedly powers off or restarts, ensuring seamless remote access in any situation. The app allows users to turn on the PC, automatically enter a preset password to unlock it, and manage basic controls reliably from anywhere.
